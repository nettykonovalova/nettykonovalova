## Hi, I'm Anasiasiia 👋

**`(Software Developer/Product Designer)`**

## 🚀 About Me
I’ve spent the last 10 years figuring out how to make things work—for businesses, for users, and now, for the machines that power them. My journey isn't a straight line, and that’s my greatest strength. 

From leading software project teams for major banks to designing life-critical **Health Tech systems**, I have always focused on the "0-to-1" journey. Currently, I’m at **42 Porto**, diving deep into the technical architecture (C, C++, Python) to build the engines behind the interfaces I design.

- 🎨 **Expertise:** Product Design (UX/UI), Health Tech Systems (EHR/RIS), Design Systems, and Product Strategy.
- 🛠️ **Current Learning:** C, C ++, Python, Memory Management, and Data Structures at 42 Porto.
- 🌍 **Perspective:** 4 countries, 4 languages (English, Ukrainian, Russian, Portuguese), and 10 years of cross-industry problem-solving.
